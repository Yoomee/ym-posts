NOTES:

1. May need to include jquery.ui.autocomplete styles in app, e.g. in application.css:

 *= require jquery.ui.autocomplete
 
2. Init the comments form in document ready, e.g. in application.js.coffee:

  YmComments.Form.init({submitOnEnter: true})
  
3. Don't forget to also call the ym_tags install if neccessary, e.g. in terminal:

   $ rails g ym_tags:install
